  Metric: ECSServiceAverageCPUUtilization
  Target Value: 70.0%
  ```
- CloudWatch Alarms:
  - High CPU Utilization (>70%)
  - Low CPU Utilization (<63%)

## 4. Monitoring and Logging
✅ Requirements Met:
- CloudWatch Logs:
  ```
  Log Group: /ecs/ecs-fargate-demo
  Retention: 30 days
  ```
- CloudWatch Alarms:
  - CPU Utilization tracking
  - Auto-scaling triggers configured
  - Service health monitoring

## 5. Deployment Strategy
✅ Requirements Met:
- Rolling Deployment:
  ```
  minimumHealthyPercent: 100
  maximumPercent: 200
  ```
- Task Definition:
  ```
  CPU: 256
  Memory: 512MB
  Platform: FARGATE
  ```
- Container Health Checks:
  - Path: /health
  - Port: 80
  - Protocol: HTTP

## 6. Security Configuration
✅ Requirements Met:
- Network Security:
  - Private subnets for ECS tasks
  - Public subnets for ALB
  - Security groups properly configured
- Access Control:
  - ALB security group: Allows port 80 inbound
  - ECS security group: Allows traffic only from ALB
  - Task IAM roles configured

## Testing Evidence
- Health Checks: Passing (200 responses logged)
- Load Balancer: Active and routing traffic
- Tasks: Running in multiple AZs
- Logs: Application startup and requests visible in CloudWatch

## Conclusion
All requirements have been successfully implemented and verified with evidence from AWS service outputs. The deployment demonstrates high availability, security, and proper monitoring as specified in the requirements.
